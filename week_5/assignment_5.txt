Python for Informatics
Assignment 5
“Message Frequency Count”

Description:
	•	Write a program that reads through the mail box data and when you find a line that starts with “From”, extract the address information from the line. Count the number of messages from each person by using a dictionary. Note that you might need to look at more than “From” because of duplicate instances of the address (hint: “From “ vs. “From:”).
	•	After all of the data has been read, print the person with the highest number of messages. To do this, create a list of tuples (count, email) from the dictionary, sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the highest number of messages.
Deliverable:
Two files as attachments at our course shell assignment page. The first file should be a Python .py file with the specified functionality. The second file should be a screenshot image file (.png or .jpg) demonstrating the correct execution of your program with “mbox.txt”.  Please ensure that your full name is specified as a Python comment at the top of the .py file.
